# 🌿 VegieHub – Connecting Farmers & Retailers

📌 **Overview**  
VegieHub is a web-based platform that bridges the gap between farmers and retailers, enabling direct crop trading without middlemen.  
Farmers can list available vegetables, fruits, and crops, while retailers can browse listings, place orders, and make payments.
